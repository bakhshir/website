In advance of the webinar that will take place on 20 March, where we will talk about professionalization for RSEs, we've compiled a list of [resources](https://nl-rse.org/pages/resources). These may be useful for RSEs, as well as anyone hiring, training and working with research software engineers. 

Those interested in professionalization for RSEs are encouraged to join the webinar on 20 March. You can register [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/professional-paths-for-research-software-engineers-tickets-1255492966259?aff=oddtdtcreator) to receive the Zoom link. 

If you have suggestions to add to our list of resources, fill out an issue [here](https://github.com/nl-rse/website/issues).
