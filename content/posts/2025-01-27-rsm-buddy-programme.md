## Buddy programme for research software professionals in the Netherlands!

The National Coordination Point Research Data Management (LCRDM) has launched a buddy programme connecting experienced and early-career Research Software Engineers (RSEs) and research software support staff across the Netherlands. The buddy programme connects pairs of RSEs and research supporters together so that they have a single point of contact that they can ask advice from or share their expertise with. 

The programme also organizes monthly online lunch sessions where participants of the buddy programme can share their experience in their roles and different aspects of research software management. Each monthly lunch session features a presentation on topics relevant to the RSE community, such as the upcoming presentation of the report 'Professionalizing the role of Research Software Engineers in the Netherlands'. 

This initiative creates opportunities for RSEs and software supporters to learn from each other's experiences, share best practices, and build a stronger national network of research software professionals. 

Interested in joining the buddy programme? Contact info@lcrdm.nl for more information about participating. 

The next online lunch session is scheduled for 30 January, 2025 and will feature a presentation of the report on professionalizing RSEs in the Netherlands, put together by an LCRDM task group.
