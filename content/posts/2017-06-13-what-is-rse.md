Research Software Engineers (RSEs) are the people that closely collaborate
with researchers to understand the challenges they face, and then develop
research software to provide the answers. Some have started as researchers
who spent a lot of time developing software to do their research. Others
have started as software developers who have developed a strong affinity
with scientific research.

While the RSEs are extremely valuable to the scientific community, they
currently lack a formal place in the academic system. This means
there is no easy way to recognise their contribution, to reward
them, or to represent their views.

Without a name, it is difficult for people to rally around a
cause, that is why the term Research Software Engineer was
created. We are now working, together with RSE associations in the
[UK](http://rse.ac.uk/) and [Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de),
to raise awareness of the role, and to bring the
RSE community in the Netherlands together.
