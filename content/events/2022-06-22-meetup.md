# Should research software be free?
**June 22, 2022 -- 13:00 - 14:00**

<!--Nearly all academic fields completely depend on software.
Much of this software is community-maintained open source software,
but there are lots of tools which are internal to institutes or owned by individuals.-->

In this workshop we explore the openness of research software:

- Is it better for our community to aim for open software?
- How can it impact your career to release your own software
- Is it possible to release your research codes? How?

We've invited two experts to discuss the pros and cons of releasing your code:

### Thomas Pronk: "Why OS will only work for your little hobby project"
Personally, I'm a fan of open source. Many people, especially those less concerned with technology, are not. In this talk I'm going to summarize the critiques against open source that Iâ€™ve heard most often or found most convincing, as well as list some scenarios where my own pro-OS proclivities were challenged. By taking such a critical stance, I hope to sharpen ideas about how OS could best focus their efforts. What unique qualities should we exploit? What deficiencies should we address? Where shouldn't we even bother?
### Lourens Veen: "Free and Open Source Software is the bees knees"
If we just opened up all the world's software, we'd never have a problem again. That's my opinion, at least for the purpose of this presentation, and I plan to defend it! Science has enabled the world we live in, and in this time of global change more and better science is desperately needed te keep it all from falling apart again. Free and Open Source software promotes collaboration, enables fair competition, and can save us all a great amount of time and effort. And that improved efficiency and effectiveness just might be what ends up saving the world.

After this, we will have a Q&A session and time for discussion.

In a follow-up workshop (early july) we will discuss how to get your organization to encourage open source software contributions.
