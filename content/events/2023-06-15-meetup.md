## Abstracts

### Automated Testing of Scientific Software
Automated testing is crucial for preventing bugs in code, and while it's widely used in industry, it's still on the rise in research contexts. In this meetup, [Daan van Vugt](https://linkedin.com/in/daanv), founder of [Ignition Computing](https://ignitioncomputing.com) and [Afterservice](https://afterservice.nl), will discuss testing approaches for research software and contrast them with a perspective from the SaaS world.

Attendees will gain insights into testing strategies and tools that can streamline the development process of scientific software. After the presentation, attendees will split into focus groups to discuss language-specific challenges and participate in hands-on development of tests and CI/CD pipelines with guidance from language experts.
