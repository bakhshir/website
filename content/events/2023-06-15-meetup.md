# Introduction to automated software testing
**June 15, 2023 | 13:15 - 16:45**

In this meetup, we will discuss approaches for testing scientific software.
Attendees can bring their own codes, and get advice on how to get started or improve their testing.

*This session is aimed at researchers who are interested in software testing but have little experience with it*


## Location
[Centre for Digital Scholarship, Leiden University Library, Witte Singel 27, Leiden](https://goo.gl/maps/JgG4bmXW3LtMxDZ36)
The CDS is on the ground floor of the Leiden University Library, directly straight across the main room from the entrance.
There will be a neon sign above the door that says Centre for Digital Scholarship.


## Registration
The registration is free.

## Abstracts

### Automated Testing of Scientific Software
Automated testing is crucial for preventing bugs in code, and while it's widely used in industry, it's still on the rise in research contexts. In this meetup, [Daan van Vugt](https://linkedin.com/in/daanv), founder of [Ignition Computing](https://ignitioncomputing.com) and [Afterservice](https://afterservice.nl), will discuss testing approaches for research software and contrast them with a perspective from the SaaS world.

Attendees will gain insights into testing strategies and tools that can streamline the development process of scientific software. After the presentation, attendees will split into focus groups to discuss language-specific challenges and participate in hands-on development of tests and CI/CD pipelines with guidance from language experts.
