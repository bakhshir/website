# Should research software be free?
**November 9, 2022 | 13:15 - 17:30 | SURF meetingroom 3.5, Utrecht**

In this meetup we explore the openness of research software:

- Is it better for our community to aim for open software?
- How can it impact your career to release your own software
- Is it possible to release your research codes? How?

We have a full programme with many interesting talks

# Abstracts

### Jo Evershed: "Making the Most of Industry Partnerships"
*"Give ordinary people the right tools, and they will design and build the most extraordinary things." Neil Gershenfeld.*
With more closed-source software embracing Open Science, it's time to change the relationship between Research Software Companies and in-house Research Software Engineers. Join Jo Evershed to discover how Gorilla is supporting Open Science, and empowering RSEs to support behavioural scientists.

### Lourens Veen: "Free and Open Source Software is the bees knees"
If we just opened up all the world's software, we'd never have a problem again. That's my opinion, at least for the purpose of this presentation, and I plan to defend it! Science has enabled the world we live in, and in this time of global change more and better science is desperately needed te keep it all from falling apart again. Free and Open Source software promotes collaboration, enables fair competition, and can save us all a great amount of time and effort. And that improved efficiency and effectiveness just might be what ends up saving the world.

### André Offringa: "Experiences from the Astron Open Source committee"
ASTRON has recently published version 2.0 of their Open Source Policy. In this talk we tell what the policy means and give some insights in the lessons learned from the updating process.

# Speakers

## Reinder Radersma
Reinder is coordinator of the [NWO-I Digital Competence Center](https://www.nwo-i.nl/en/nwo-i-projects/nwo-i-digital-competence-center/); the center of expertise for open and reproducible data and software management at the NWO institutes. Before he worked for 12 years as a researcher in evolutionary biology in the Netherlands, UK and Sweden focusing on data intensive projects such as social network analyses and statistical genetics.

## Lourens Veen
Lourens is a Senior RSE at the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/), where he has worked since 2016. He has been programming since he was ten years old, professionally since 2007. In 1999, he discovered Free Software when he got a copy of SuSE Linux 6.1, and he hasn't looked back. He is the author of several Open Source packages, lead designer of the Dutch National Database of Flora and Fauna, and was involved with the Open Graphics Project and the Open Hardware Foundation. Lourens' scientific background is in computer science, biogeography and modelling and simulation.

## Jo Evershed
Jo is the co-founder of Cauldron Science and creator of the [Gorilla Experiment Builder](https://gorilla.sc). Her ultimate ambition is to help behavioral scientists liberate their work from the lab and accelerate the creation of evidence-tested behavioral interventions.

## André Offringa
André is an associate staff scientist at [Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON)](http://www.astron.nl/) since 2014, and has a position of "Universitair Docent" (assistant professor) at the University of Groningen.
