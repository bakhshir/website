# 1st NL-RSE Reusabilithon

## What is a reusabilithon?
Very similar in format and spirit to the already successful [Reprohack](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/). During a reusabilithon, participants assess the reusability of software (a small script or a big library -- it is all software!) with the help of a minimum requirements list.

The long term aim of running a *reusabilithon* is making RSE's (and researchers who write code) aware of what reusability is about and to develop their expertise in using tools to improve the reusability of the software they produce. Read more our about [previous experiences](/posts/2021-04-21-software%20reusability) with reusabilithons.

## Save the date!
Sounds interesting? Save the date in your calendar and **join our NL-RSE Meetup on February 12, 2022**.

## Participate!
You can participate in several ways:
 - You can submit your software and receive feedback on its reusability.
 - You can join as a reviewer and assess the reusability of submitted software.
 - You can do both!
