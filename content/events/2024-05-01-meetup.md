## Why use Rust for Research Software?

Have you heard about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)? It is a language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software. Learning a new language may sound like a bit time commitment and a bit intimidating, but it doesn't need to be!

In this meetup our speakers will share their experiences building research software using Rust. From simple user facing applications, graphical user interfaces, libraries, R and Python bindings, etc. Join us and discover all that Rust can do for your research!

## Location
SURF | Hoog Catharijne (Utrecht Centraal)
Moreelsepark 48 3511 EP Utrecht.

## Registration
The registration is free.
