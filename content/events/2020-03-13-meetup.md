## Abstracts

### Gijs Molenaar "Training a reinforcement agent with simulations of the Dutch electricity Grid to optimize long-term investment strategies"
As a free-lance research engineer, I'm currently involved in creating a simulation of the Dutch electricity grid maintained by Alliander. These simulations run 40 years in the future, repeated numerous times each with a different set of random growth conditions. The outputs of these simulations are used to train a deep reinforcement agent the optimise long-term investment strategies of the company.

In this talk, I will talk about the tools and techniques used (Python, NumPy, Kubernetes, Neo4j), our development infrastructure and our team's work distribution.

### Emmy Tsang "Community driven solutions for better research communication"
The advancement of web technologies has created an opportunity for developing tools for real-time collaborations, text-mining, interactive data visualisations, sharing reproducible compute environments, etc. These tools can change the ways researchers share, discover, consume and evaluate research and help promote open science and encourage responsible research behaviours. Through its Innovation Initiative, eLife invests heavily in software development, new product design, collaboration and outreach so that the potential for improvements in the digital communication of new research can start to be realised. In this talk, I hope to share some of the tools and projects we've been supporting and creating and hope to invite feedback and contributions from the NL-RSE community on the next steps forward.

### Felipe Zapata "Continuous integration and Continuous Delivery for scientific applications"
Continuous integration is the practice of integrating code changes into a software project in an automated way.
In this hands-on session, we will explore how to create pipelines to automate the process of building and
testing scientific software, using open source tools like GitHub actions, GitlabCI and Travis.
