# RSE Demoes & Panel Discussion

## Curious what RSEs in different domains get up to?
We've invited 3 RSEs to showcase projects they have completed. See the description of each demo below:

1. Marianne de Heer Kloots - TOPIC TBD
2. Candace Makeda Moore - TOPIC TBD
3. Martine de Vos - TOPIC TBD

After this, we will have a panel discussion with the three RSEs above, and Alejandra HÃ©rnandez from RIVM. To honour International Women's Day, we will touch upon the topic of gender diversity in the profession.

## Join us!
Sounds interesting? Join our NL-RSE Meetup on March 8, 2022.
