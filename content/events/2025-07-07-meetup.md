## Abstracts

### Xavier Farré Álvarez - overview of GPU, TPU capability growth in the past few years
Xavier Álvarez Farré is a Supercomputing Advisor at SURF and the EuroCC vice coordinator for HPC training in the Netherlands.

Xavier will provide an overview of trends in the GPU landscape and beyond, and how these match specific computations. He'll explain how and where to get access, and showcase the work of the SURF Experimental Technologies platform.

#### SURF Experimental Technologies Platform (ETP)
ETP is an open and collaborative environment as experimental hardware infrastructure where a dedicated team of expert system administrators and advisors foster the assessment of cutting-edge ICT technologies and methodologies. The ETP focuses on optimizing complex workflows, enhancing energy efficiency, and cultivating a vibrant community of researchers and engineers developing emerging techniques. It also stimulates knowledge sharing and dissemination through various means. 
ETP consists of several edge technology hardware for compute, network, storage and infrastructure (i.e., Liqid composable infrastructure). In particular, it has accelerators such as AMD MI210 GPU, Nvidia GH200 Grace Hopper, AMD VCK5000 FPGA Versal and AMD Alveo U250 FPGA card.
