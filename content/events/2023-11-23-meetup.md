# Professionalisation for RSEs: Where Do We Go From Here?
We invite you to come and discuss how to create opportunities for advancing RSE career paths and consider lessons learned in other fields.


How might we develop a thriving professional culture for research software engineers across the Netherlands? As national efforts in Reward and Recognition evolve toward a more nuanced understanding of contributions to research, what can we do to better support the role of research software engineers?

At this NL-RSE meetup, we will discuss recent developments in creating opportunities for advancing RSE career paths and consider lessons from analogous efforts in data stewardship. An interactive discussion will follow the panel to seek input from the RSE community on how best to support their potential for professional growth. We would particularly appreciate peopleâ€™s stories in seeking employment, hiring, retention, and advancement.
