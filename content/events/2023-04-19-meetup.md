## Abstracts

### Bugs in Research Software and Data

We all make mistakes, right? Yet, research outputs like papers, datasets and software are often expected and treated as if they do not contain any. During this meetup, [Daniël Lakens](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/daniel-lakens/) will discuss the consequences of treating your data and software as static, rather than alive and in need of continuous updates. Daniël is Associate Professor in the Human-Technology interaction group at TU Eindhoven and avid critic of incentive structures in academia. We will invite you to share your own stories about mistakes you may have made, or are still making. We will highlight why having data stewards and research software engineers around, in the context of preventing, fixing, and updating faulty research objects.

Daniël is also the author of the [20% statistician blog](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/), and host of the podcast [Nullius in Verbia](https://nulliusinverba.podbean.com/).

This event is co-organized by Dutch Community for Research Software Engineers (NL-RSE) and the Health-RI [Data Stewardship Community](https://www.health-ri.nl/about-health-ri/organisation/fair-data/health-ri-data-stewardship-community).
