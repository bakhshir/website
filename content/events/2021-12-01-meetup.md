## Abstracts

### Software Development & Management Practices: A loose comparison between the academic and industrial settings.

Academic software development and management practices (particularly as conducted outside dedicated RSE organisations) often differ from those of commercial development settings, and are often researched and tested much less in-depth. In this talk by Derek Groen (Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at Brunel, involved in 5 research software projects and guilty of 180 GitHub commits in the last year) and Sorrel Harriet (current Continuous Learning Lead at Armakuni and previously Lecturer at Leeds Trinity University) we look at these practices from a few different angles. We summarize a case study of software development practices in four open-source scientific codes over a period of nine years and show that the transient nature of the development team results in the adoption of different development strategies, and that many of the academic benefits (e.g. in published papers) are only measurable three years after the development has completed. We also provide insights from a recent survey we conducted among academics on common practices in research software projects, and provide insights on how concepts from agile coaching (such as a focus on team learning, surfacing tech debt and redefining what is considered success) could bring possible benefit for RSE projects. Last but not least, we'll share some of our own experiences in research software development as part of large-scale (EU) projects, and open the floor for collective brainstorming on how we can all do a better job!
